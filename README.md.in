# Î¼doc - Another minimalistic documentation generator

This is just a set of scripts to generate documentation from any programming language.
The idea is to divide the process in two steps:

1. Extract the documentation from the source code and store it in a JSON file.
   The scripts implementing this part should be named `x2doc`, where `x` is the programming language.
   At the moment, only `py2doc` is implemented.
2. Format the documentation in Markdown. The script implementing this part is `doc2md`.
   It just copy verbatim the documentation from the JSON file to the Markdown file.
   The only exceptions to this rule are the following:
   * Every entry in the JSON file is a section in the Markdown file. The script formats the heading.
   * When a text chunk is marked as code, the script formats it as a fenced code block.
   * For every composed Markdown file, the script injects at the end all known [link destinations](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.30/#link-destination).
   Any additional formatting should be done in the documentation itself.
