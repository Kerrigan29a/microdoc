# Î¼doc - A minimalistic documentation generator

This is just a set of scripts to generate documentation from any programming language.
The idea is to divide the process into two steps:

1. Extract the documentation from the source code and save it to a JSON file.
   The scripts implementing this part should be named `x2doc`, where `x` is the programming language.
   At the moment, only `py2doc` is implemented.

2. Format the documentation in Markdown. The script implementing this part is `doc2md`.
   It just copies verbatim the documentation from the JSON file to the Markdown file.
   The only exceptions to this rule are the following ones:

   * Every element in the JSON file is a section of the Markdown file. The script formats the heading.

   * When a text chunk is marked as code, the script formats it as a [fenced code block](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#fenced-code-blocks) with [syntax highlighting](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#syntax-highlighting).

   * For each generated Markdown file, the script injects all known [link destinations](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.30/#link-destination) at the end of the file.
   
   Any additional formatting should be done in the documentation itself.
